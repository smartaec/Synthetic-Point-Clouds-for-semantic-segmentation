The results for the paper "Impact of color and mixing proportion of synthetic point clouds on semantic segmentation"

## Introdution
In the paper, we propose a method for generating synthetic point clouds based on BIM models, and explore the impact of the mixing proportions (synthetic & real point clouds) on the training performance of semantic segmentation models. 
The impact of the mixing proportions between synthetic and real point clouds on the training of PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN models has been presented in the paper. 
At the same time, we are actively exploring the potential of synthetic point clouds on more advanced semantic segmentation models or network architectures. 
The latest results will be updated in this repository.
